Notes on how to use Git


Git is a fancy version control system that allows you to manage a project
with non commital changes until you are certain.

To install Git you can
git --version
# verify if it is already installed
sudo apt install git-all
# Install Git the whole friggin program

Don't forget to read the manual
man git

Porcelain and plumbing
There are 2 types of commands, porcelain are high-level commands that
interacts with my code.
git status, add, commit, push, pull ,log, etc.
Plumbing are more [...]
git apply, commit-tree, hash-object

GIT CONFIG

To configure git you will need to use git config
you can get your git name/email using 
git config --get user.name
# This will return your git username
However if the name isn't set it is preferable to add it first (user.email)
git config --add --global user.name "name"
# This will add your git username to the git config ~/.gitconfig

We can also set the default branch in git config
git config --global init.defaultBranch master
# Now if a branch is using the default value it will use ~/.gitconfig and
# take the name master
use cat ~/.gitconfig to verify these informations

At the START of the project
Create a REPOSITORY (repo) on the root directory of your project
git init
# This will create a hidden .git directory on the current directory
# The project is now able to use git functions 

file status
A file can be one of 3 status in a Git Repository
	untracked: Not being tracked by Git (red)
	staged: Marked for inclusion in the next commit (green)
	committed: Saved to the repository's history

git status
# This gives you the status of all files in the Repository

Stage a file
Untracked file need to be turned into a staged file, this process will 
add the file to the index of the repository
git add untracked.md
# this will make the untracked file staged, git will now be able to manage
# these files (green in status)

Commit a file
A commit will take a snapshot of the current file and applies the change
to the current branch. Any uncommited changes are at risk of getting lost
git commmit -m "message for clarity"
# This will commit ALL of the staged files in the repository and (-m) add
# a message that helps identify what the changes entails.

RECAP

git status
# Gives the details of your repository
git add
# Stage a file
git commit
# Apply the changes to the current branch
git log (git --no-pager log -n 10)
# Shows a history of the commits made (...that limits the nb shown)


***INTERNALS***

commit hash (or SHA-1)
Each commit has a unique identifyer called a hash that looks like this :
5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f

all the data from the repository can be found in .got/objects
The file should begin with the first 2 numbers of your hash
It is unfortunately compressed to raw bytes

To read a file that has been compressed to raw bytes you can :
xxd path/to/file/from-before
# This will open the file in a hexadecimal format that looks like this
00000000: 7801 9d8e 416a 0421 1000 73f6 15fd 810c  x...Aj.!..s.....

Cat file
Git has a built in plumbing command called cat-file that allows us to
explore commits easily. 
git cat-file -p <hash>
# This will give us a way to see all the information related to the hash
git cat-file -p <hash> > /tmp/catfileout.txt
# This will store the information in a temporary file

Tree and blob
When exploring the hash of a commit using cat-file you will find data 
including a hash named tree, the author and a commit message.
We cannot see the message of the file itself because it is further in the
hash sequence.

By looking at the hash for the tree you will find the blob hash

Commit hash(snapshot in time) v
			      Tree(directory) v
					      Blob(file content)

		
*** GIT CONFIG***

You can change the configuration of a git project via git config
This will modify the file located in ~/.gitconfig
These include
git config --add --global user.name "YourName"
git config --add --global user.email "Your@email.here"

git config --list --local
# This will show you the content of the local config

git config --get user.name (<section>.<keyname>)
# This will get the first information from the key (<section>.<keyname>)

git config --unset <section>.<keyname>
# This will remove the first occurence of a specific key 

git config --unset-all <section>.<keyname>
# This will remove ALL instances of a specific key
# Adding -all to most options will allow the option to cover all data 
# instead of the first data found.

That being said you can have duplicate of the same key carrying different
information. For instance company.employee will have multiple employee.
in that case make sure to use --get-all to get all the data.

To remove a <section> without specifying a <keyname> you can use
git config --remove-section <section>
# This will get rid of the entire section 

Locationsystem: /etc/gitconfig, a file that configures Git for all users on the system
global: ~/.gitconfig, a file that configures Git for all projects of a user
local: .git/config, a file that configures Git for a specific project
worktree: .git/config.worktree, a file that configures Git for part of a project
Git can be configured in multiple places as a hierarchy :

system: /etc/gitconfig, a file that configures Git for all users on the system
  vv
global: ~/.gitconfig, a file that configures Git for all projects of a user
  vv
local: .git/config, a file that configures Git for a specific project
g  vv
worktree: .git/config.worktree, a file that configures Git for part of a project

--global is the most used in general as it includes the projects directly.
--local is used sometimes to tweak a specific project

As you go lower in the hierarchy the keys will automatically default to the
location higher than itself if it does not have a value of its own.
If --local has no user.name it will take --global user.name


***WHAT IS A BRANCH***

See the current branches active using 
git branch

Rename a branch 
git branch -m oldname newname

changing the init.defaultBranch could be useful (?)
git config --global init.defaultBranch="main"

Create a new branch
git branch (-c) my_new_branch
# this will create a new branch (-c will have it switch to it)

Switch to a different branch
git switch other_branch
# you are now in the other branch, use git branch to see the active branch

To do the entire step of commiting a brand new file to git
Create file [untracked]
git add file.csv [staged]
git commit -m "added file.csv" [commited]
# And voilà you have a brand new commit that added the file to the branch !

Git Log customization
decorate= full, short or no
git log --decorate=full
# this will also grant you the ref name of each commit
git log --oneline
# This will severely compact the output, making it only take 1 line
# Using both is pretty handy too

You can find the head of all branches by going into .git/refs/heads
there is 1 file per branch that contains the hash of the latest commit


***MERGE***

Merging will send a branch back to the main branch by applying all changes

A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    other_branch

vvvvvvvvvvvvvv

A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        other_branch


While on the main branch (git switch main)
git merge other_branch
# This will take the other_branch and commit all the changes to main in a
# new commit
in more details the merge will :
1.Find the "merge base" commit, or "best common ancestor" of the two branches. In this case, A.
2.Replay the changes from main, starting from the best common ancestor, into a new commit.
3.Replay the changes from vimchadsonly onto main, starting from the best common ancestor.
4.Records the result as a new commit, in our case, F.
5.F is special because it has two parents, C and E.

git log --oneline --decorate --graph --parents
# This will show you how the graph has merged visually

Fast forward merge
if your branches look like this : 
      C     delete_vscode
     /
A - B       main

# The merge code will do a fast-forward merge that will result in this
            delete_vscode
A - B - C   main
# no commit is created in that case since delete_vscode became the new main

This is a common workflow when working with Git on a team of developers:

1.Create a branch for a new change
2.Make the change
3.Merge the branch back into main (or whatever branch your team dubs the "default" branch)
4.Remove the branch
5.Repeat 

Delete/remove a branch
git branch -d unused_branch
# This will remove the branch entirely 


***REBASE***

Make the new branch and turn it into the NEW MAIN. It is ideal  for solo 
projects as confilcts can emerge if multiple branches exist

A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    feature_branch

vvvvv

A - B - C         main
         \
          D - E   feature_branch


New branch from an old commit, even an outdated one
git switch -c update_dune COMMITHASH
# Using the hash from an old commit this will give us an old version of 
# the project

From that old commit you can bring it up to date if you rebase main
git rebase main
# This will take your current branch and append it to the end of main
# Every changes present in main will be applied to your branch and then
# All the branch changes will be applied on top of that


***RESETING OR UNDOING***

If you made a mistake or dislike a change and you need to go back to a 
	previous version of a commit
git reset --soft COMMITHASH
# --soft will turn the commited changes into uncommited. This way you can
# review the files

git reset --hard COMMITHASH
# This will delete all the changes after the commit
# This is irreversible as there is no longer a commit available going forward



***GIT REMOTE***

You can add a remote that acts like its own repo, kinda like a github.
git remote add <name> <uri>
# This will link the <uri> database to the current one

fetch is necessary to get all the data from the good database to this one
( information only )
git fetch (inside local project directory)
# This will bring forth all the metadata files from the main project
# This means that you have no commit and no files

Remote log
You can get the log from the master project 
git log <name>/<branch>
# This will give the log from the faraway repo

Remote merge. You can remote merge a local and remote repo 
( bring all data over )

git merge <name>/<branch>
# This will bring forth the desired commit from remote as well as all
# the files. 



***GITHUB***

GitHub is an online storage area that uses Git

GitHub Repo setup (linking your project to GitHub)
1. Create a brand new repository on the GitHub webpage using the name of 
	your project
2. (1 time) install the GitHub CLI to allow for some GitHub commands
3. Authenticate using gh auth login : gh auth login
	GitHub.com
	HTTPS
	YES
	Login to a web browser
4. Go to the location of your project folder in Bash
5. Add a remote to your project pointing to your GitHub Repo
	git remote add origin https://github.com/Franc3D/webflyx.git
	# find the address on your GitHub repo webpage
6. Verify that the remote worked using 
	git ls-remote
	# From https://github.com/Franc3D/webflyx.git

Git push
Sends local changes to any remote, this will only send the metadata 
(local to GitHub)
git push origin <branch>
# This will send all the commits to your GitHub server 

git pull [<remote>/<branch>]
Take the data from the remote and apply it to the local. [] is optionnal.
This will take place in the web browser on GiHub.com
1. On github press edit this file 
2. press the commit button and change the title of the commit

back on bash
3. Ensure we do a merge by entering git config pull.rebase false
4. pull the new commit with git pull origin main
5. A new merge commit will be created, rename

and here you go, you just imported the change from GitHub to bash

Pull Requests on GitHub
When you send a push request on GitHub it has to get approved before 
it is integrated. 
1. Push a new branch with : git push origin add_classics
2. on GitHub go the the Pull Request tab
3. From there you can adjust the details of the push request and finish 
	its creation.
The team now has access to the details of the pull request, we are ready 
to merge

merging in GitHub
In a team you would need approval to merge to main but as a solo dev you
	can do whatever you want.

1. on GitHub in the pull request tab, confirm the merge + commit message
2. Press the button to delete the current workbranch (if not main)
3. on bash in main branch : git pull origin main to get the confirmation
	metadata ( visible as a commit )
4. Delete the work branch ( not main )
# now your request is merged in GitHub and you got the confirmation in 
# local. Everything is up to date. Your comorkers will have to pull the
# new main to their personal branch to stay up to date. 

Insights on workflow
rebase is easier to follow than merge as a solo dev, think of it as main
	being version 0.1 while the rebase is the 0.2 in progress.
git config --global pull.rebase true
# This will always rebase instead of merging 

Use GitHub to backup your project, it can't catch fire probably

Solo workflow: 
	
	Make changes to files
	git add . (or git add <files> if I only want to add specific files)
	git commit -m "a message describing the changes"
	git push origin main
	git log --oneline

Team Workflow
	
1.Update my local main branch with git pull origin main
2.Checkout a new branch for the changes I want to make with 
	git switch -c <branchname>
Make changes to files
3.git add .
4.git commit -m "a message describing the changes"
5.git push origin <branchname> (I push to the new branch name, not main)
6.Open a pull request on GitHub to merge my changes into main
7.Ask a team member to review my pull request
8.Once approved, click the "Merge" button on GitHub to merge my changes 
	into main
9.Delete my feature branch, and repeat with a new branch for the next set
	 of changes

Gitignore
a .gitignore file will tell git to ignore specific files
You can create a .gitignore file everywhere you wish in your project
Modify the content of the file to include the text like :
	# add comments
	duck.txt
	*.txt
	!important.txt ( the ! allows for exceptions, will be let throughç)
	/main.py ( the root / is where the .gitignore file is )
	private/*
	!private/duck_info.txt

What should your ignore ?
1. Ignore things that can be generated 
	(e.g. compiled code, minified files, etc.)
2. Ignore dependencies (e.g. node_modules, venv, packages, etc.)
3. Ignore things that are personal or specific to how you like to work 
	(e.g. editor settings)
4. Ignore things that are sensitive or dangerous 
	(e.g. .env files, passwords, API keys, etc.)


Pandoc
Converts files from one format to another
.md > html for instance
pandoc advert.md -o advert.html
# This creates a brand new advert.html based on the advert.md file

open html file in a browser
explorer.exe advert.html
# opens the file in default browser
