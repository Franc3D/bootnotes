How to organize a projets correctly

project location
	~/workspace/HOSTNAME/USERNAME/REPONAME
	which might look a little something like this
	~/workspace/github.com/bootdotdev/curriculum

If you start your project on GitHub most of it is already configured
	Start by creating a repo on github
	create a directory leading to ~/workspace/HOSTNAME/USERNAME/REPONAME
	git clone https://github.com/Franc3D/bookbot.git
	The project has been added after REPONAME/

Send project to VScode at any time from your current location
	code .
	code file.txt

Commit from github (a recap)
	Change a file
	git add . (to add all changed files)
	git commit -m "message"
	gh auth login (only on new platform)
	git push origin main

installing python 3 on your WSL
	python3 --version (verify if you have it already)
	if not:
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install -y python3
	read the installation logs

What to .gitignore
	Data like entire books should not be part of the GitHub
	temp data should be ignored as well

With block (reading and storing the content of a file)
	with open(path_to_file) as f:
    # do something with f (the file) here

	# f is a file object
	file_contents = f.read()
	# returns the content in STRING

Using multiple .py files and importing (refactoring)
	you can store your functions in different files for convenience
	in your main.py file you would write at the start
	from file_name import name_of_function  EXEMPLE from stats import get_num_words
	# do not add .py for the stats.py file !

making a pretty report using .sort()
	.sort() only works on lists, not dictionary
	a normal list is simple enough :
	x = [4,2,7,1,9]
	x.sort() >>> x = [1,2,4,7,9]
	
	Look at the sort.py file for more information
